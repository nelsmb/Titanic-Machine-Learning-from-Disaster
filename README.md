# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
In this notebook we examine the Titanic dataset and then we build a model that can predict if a passenger survived the sinking or not. We start with finding feature types, missing values and we continue with feature analysis and visualization of the data. Feature engineering is implemented to create new attributes, encoding and imputation of the missing values. At last we test several classifiers and we evaluate them with the help of the ROC and CAP curves.
